# Appendix A: Documentation as Code

There is a profound recognition that the principles and corollaries captured in the ACTS will evolve and change over
time, just like software. In Chapter 1, we openly disclosed that the focus of this report is primarily the software arm
of the digital triad, inviting those with rich industry expertise in data and AI/ML to build on this body of work to
support PEOs with actionable principles. In Chapter 4, we introduced and discussed the value of documentation as code.

We are taking a novel approach with this report, opting both to publish the static PDF and to establish a GitHub
repository that contains the ACTS and their definitions in markdown format along with its graphical images. It is our
sincere hope that experts in data and AI/ML will literally build on this body of work. Adopting GitHub provides a
lightweight consensus mechanism supported via threaded discussions associated with individual pull requests to ensure
highly refined contributions.

We invite and encourage the broader community, including those in the DoD as military members or part of its civilian
workforce and those who are part of the broader defense industrial base, to suggest edits and offer new ACTS using git
branching and pull requests. Through collaboration, it may be possible to enhance the material and ensure its relevance
over time. This approach also provides an opportunity to pivot away from social platform paradigms, like LinkedIn, that
offer only a forum for academic dialogue and constructive criticism without an opportunity for meaningful follow-up
actions.
