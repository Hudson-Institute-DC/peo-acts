# ACTS 1: Evaluate Existing Software Factories before Building Your Own
Launching a brand-new software factory within the DoD is an exhausting and expensive endeavor. Frustratingly, effort 
invested in such a launch does not directly contribute to progress in the acquisition outcomes or warfighting capability 
that most acquisition professionals are accountable to provide. Stated differently, just because the software factory 
achieves full operational capacity does not mean it releases production software that provides value to the warfighter. 
Thus, both to accelerate delivery of capability and to stretch program funding, the first step in a software acquisition 
development should be to explore whether existing software factories can meet program needs. The good news is that 
substantial growth has occurred in every military department, and the likelihood of finding a suitable fit is high.

With understanding and knowledge of the continuing nature of software development and sustainment, PEOs need to grow to 
recognize and anticipate a natural ebb and flow of feature development, sustainment, and more feature development. The 
PEO–software factory relationship has to be designed to ensure that factory lights stay on during periods when a program 
requires only routine patching and minor upgrades, and yet the factory should be capable of rapidly scaling up when 
programs require new features urgently.

The scalable staff and specialized skill sets that exist across the breadth of the industrial base are better suited to 
deliver complex features, algorithms, and functionality than are government or military personnel. Yet routine patching 
and sustainment operations within an established software factory ecosystem do not require cutting-edge software 
engineering talent. Existing software factories can support PEOs during periods of sustainment while providing access 
to industrial base talent when they need to pivot toward innovative feature development.

The premise of this ACTS is that those PEOs who lack an actionable plan for realizing a long-term software factory 
relationship will operate at a program at a much higher risk of not realizing software-defined tactics compared to other 
PEOs that have achieved this objective.

## Corollary: Rationalize the Staffing Ratios between Government Civilians and Contractors
The defense prime contractors have an immense talent pool at their disposal: the top five employ 618,000 people, 
including tens of thousands of software engineers, many of whom are highly talented and experienced. However, there are 
a number of reasons these top primes are at a substantial disadvantage in an era when software defines tactics. First, 
these organizations have significant investments in highly specialized physical science research laboratories, and they 
fund their physical infrastructure through either internal research and development (IRAD) or direct capital expense 
offsets. They must amortize these investments across multiple fiscal years, which affects their cost models.

Second, the large primes more often groom future leaders from within their own ranks, which makes them less likely to 
have executives familiar with how software development has changed over the past decade. Indeed, it is often difficult 
to find leaders in a defense prime who recognize that systems engineering is not synonymous with the MIL-STD-499 V 
model and that Agile, for example, is another disciplined systems engineering approach more suited to software systems. 
Habits and prior successful experience can make it difficult to see the forest for the trees.

These challenges, combined with the firms’ inability to carry staff on a bench, with employees waiting for clearances 
or a new program to work on, make it extremely difficult for contractors to entice software development talent that has 
lived and breathed an alternative set of development practices—for example, former developers from Google, Apple, 
Amazon, Microsoft, or Meta. Work habits are also different: prime contractors have compensation and promotion 
strategies that reward loyalty, which often clashes with the twoor three-year employment rotation that is typical in 
modern Silicon Valley. The few who are willing to occasionally cross the tool and methodology chasm between the prime 
contractors of the defense industrial base and Silicon Valley do so knowing that they will have to fight a software 
development equivalency of septic shock upon arrival. As a result, modern software practices may take a long time to 
percolate into prime culture.

In contrast, smaller and nontraditional businesses across the defense industrial base have an early lead in providing 
software staff to operate government-led software factories because they neither carry the overhead nor have the 
lethargic processes that come with major primes. Smaller businesses also typically avoid the institutional investors 
that demand dividends from the senior leadership team, giving the smaller competitor more freedom to navigate job 
titles and compensation packages. Smaller businesses were often born digital and can give their software practitioners 
modern computing tools without the lethargic bureaucracy typical of large legacy prime contractors.

However, those same small businesses also have more difficulty forming a direct relationship with a program office, 
as any source selection must weigh the risks of placing a smaller company in a critical role against expected savings 
in cost and time. Small businesses are more nimble and able to align their operational models with the so-called 
software body shops than are most major primes. Both roles are necessary parts of a weapons system program, and 
establishing transparency around this fact mitigates alienating one in favor of the other.

It is often best for the program manager to take a compositional approach to their acquisition strategy: dividing 
development into chunks appropriate for different classes of industrial base performers and using the appropriate 
acquisition pathway for each chunk. These components of an acquisition may surge or recede as program needs change. 
This approach leaves some tasks—like establishing, running, or sourcing a software factory—to the program manager and 
appropriate partners.
